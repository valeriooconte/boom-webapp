# HermIA

This is a web application developed during the **B.Future Challenge** in collaboration with **Var Group**.

**HermIA** takes its name from the fusion of *Hermes*, the swift messenger of the Gods in Greek mythology, and *Artificial Intelligence*, as LLMs represent the core tool that allows us to generate such "messages" consisting of suggestions for consulting activities and meeting reports, with the aim of making the meeting moment more productive and speeding up the generation and transmission of post-meeting outputs.

You can try **HermIA** at this [**link**](https://hermia.vercel.app).

## Features

HermIA leverages **real-time analysis** of the conversation between customer and consultant, providing feedback and suggestions obtained through interaction with an **AI agent** specialized in:
- Key words identification
- Customer sentiment analysis 
- Information extraction
- Reports creation

## Technologies

The development of this platform was based on three key technologies:
- **n8n**: AI workflows realization
- **Next.js**: client-side and server-side web app implementation
- **Vercel**: web app build and deployment
